Sample: Request Info with SequentialBuilder

This sample demonstrates using the `.with_request_info()` method to pause a
SequentialBuilder workflow AFTER each agent runs, allowing external input
(e.g., human feedback) for review and optional iteration.

Purpose:
Show how to use the request info API that pauses after every agent response,
using the standard request_info pattern for consistency.

Demonstrate:
- Configuring request info with `.with_request_info()`
- Handling request_info events with AgentInputRequest data
- Injecting responses back into the workflow via run(responses=..., stream=True)

Prerequisites:
- FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Microsoft Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- FOUNDRY_MODEL must be set to your Azure OpenAI model deployment name.
- Authentication via azure-identity (run az login before executing)
