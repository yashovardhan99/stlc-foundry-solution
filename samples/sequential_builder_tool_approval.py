Sample: Sequential Workflow with Tool Approval Requests

This sample demonstrates how to use SequentialBuilder with tools that require human
approval before execution. The approval flow uses the existing @tool decorator
with approval_mode="always_require" to trigger human-in-the-loop interactions.

This sample works as follows:
1. A SequentialBuilder workflow is created with a single agent that has tools requiring approval.
2. The agent receives a user task and determines it needs to call a sensitive tool.
3. The tool call triggers a function_approval_request Content, pausing the workflow.
4. The sample simulates human approval by responding to the .
5. Once approved, the tool executes and the agent completes its response.
6. The workflow outputs the final conversation with all messages.

Purpose:
Show how tool call approvals integrate seamlessly with SequentialBuilder without
requiring any additional builder configuration.

Demonstrate:
- Using @tool(approval_mode="always_require") for sensitive operations.
- Handling request_info events with function_approval_request Content in sequential workflows.
- Resuming workflow execution after approval via run(responses=..., stream=True).

Prerequisites:
- FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT must be your Microsoft Foundry Agent Service (V2) project endpoint.
- FOUNDRY_MODEL must be set to your Azure OpenAI model deployment name.
- Basic familiarity with SequentialBuilder and streaming workflow events.
